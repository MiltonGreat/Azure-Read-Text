# Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with Azure AI Vision

### Project Overview

This project explores the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities of Azure AI Vision. OCR is a critical computer vision task that involves detecting and extracting text from images, enabling automation and efficiency in text processing tasks.

Using Azure AI Vision Studio, this project demonstrates how to experiment with text extraction from various types of images without writing any code. Vision Studio provides a user-friendly interface to explore Azure's AI capabilities, making it an excellent tool for beginners and professionals alike.

### Business Applications

1. Retail
- Extract and digitize product information from scanned labels or receipts.

2. Healthcare
- Automate the digitization of patient records or prescriptions.

3. Logistics
- Process text from shipping labels or invoices for streamlined workflows.

4. Education
- Convert scanned documents or notes into editable text for accessibility.

### Features

1. Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Detects and extracts text from images.
- Returns results in a structured format with bounding box coordinates.

2. No-Code Environment
- Experiment with OCR capabilities using Vision Studio's graphical interface.
- Avoids the need for complex programming or API integration.

3. Supports Various File Types
- Analyze text from image files like JPEG, PNG, GIF, and TIFF, as well as PDF documents.

### Project Workflow

1. Set Up an Azure AI Services Resource
- Go to the Azure portal.
- Create a resource under Azure AI Services.

2. Access Vision Studio
- Navigate to Vision Studio.
- Select OCR from the available capabilities.

3. Experiment with OCR
- Upload an image or PDF document.
- View the extracted text, bounding boxes, and raw JSON results.

### What I Learned

- OCR is a powerful tool to automate text extraction from images, saving time and reducing manual effort.
- Azure AI Vision Studio simplifies the process of exploring OCR capabilities without requiring programming skills.
- By leveraging Azure AI Vision, businesses can integrate OCR functionality to enhance operational efficiency across multiple industries.

### Future Enhancements
